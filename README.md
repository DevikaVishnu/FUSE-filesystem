# FUSE-filesystem
FUSE is an interface that allows us to call our own functions instead of using the default kernel functions when a system call is used. Using this framework, we have implemented the following functionalities: 
- Create and Remove a directory.
- Create, Read and write to a file.
- Delete an existing file.
- Appending to and truncating a file.
- Access, modified and status change time updates.
- Open and close a file
