# FUSE-filesystem
FUSE is an interface that allows us to call our own functions instead of using the default kernel functions when a system call is used. Using it, we have implemented the following functionalities: 
- Create and remove a directory.
- Create, read and write to a file.
- Delete a file.
- Append to and truncate a file.
- Access, modified and status change time updates.
- Open and close a file
